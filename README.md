# 🧠 ML_UTILS

Welcome to **ML_UTILS** – a curated collection of machine learning utility scripts, tools, and resources to accelerate your ML workflows. Whether you're preprocessing data, experimenting with model evaluation, or exploring explainability techniques, this repo is your go-to toolkit.

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

This repository will gradually evolve with useful utilities, including (but not limited to):

- 📊 **Data Preprocessing**  
  Cleaning, encoding, normalization, and feature scaling helpers.

- 🧮 **Dimensionality Reduction**  
  Scripts for PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, and autoencoder-based techniques.

- 📉 **Model Evaluation**  
  Confusion matrix plotting, custom metric calculators, cross-validation tools.

- 🪄 **ML Deployment Snippets**  
  Blue-green / canary deployment helpers, response validators, etc.

- 🧵 **MLOps Utilities**  
  Logging setups, version tracking tools, experiment management aids.

- 💬 **NLP Helpers**  
  Tokenizers, spelling correction (noisy-channel models), and text preprocessing.
